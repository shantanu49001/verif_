## üöÄ **Introduction**

In this repository, we introduce a formal verification framework for neural **Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)**. This framework addresses the challenges of verifying neural networks integrated into safety-critical systems by applying a **decomposition-based approach**.

Key highlights include:
> **Component-level verification** using Metric Interval Temporal Logic (MITL).  
> Application of **backward-induction** to ensure both system and component robustness.  
> **Distributed sequential verification** to localize potential points of failure.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Key Features**

- **Backward Induction Verification**: Sequentially verifies each component of the CPS to ensure adherence to the system‚Äôs operational limits.
- **Component Decomposition**: Breaks the system into manageable components for easier verification.
- **Scalability**: Efficiently scales to handle complex hybrid systems with multiple interconnected subsystems.
- **MATLAB Integration**: Fully implemented using MATLAB for ease of integration with existing Simulink¬Æ models.

## üß† **Methodology**

The methodology introduces a **backward-induction and sequential verification approach**. Each component is checked individually, ensuring that:
1. **Initialization**: Signal datasets are created for each component based on simulation data.
2. **Range and Step Size Selection**: Maximum and minimum signal ranges are derived from simulation results.
3. **Neural Network Verification**: Neural components are verified using a custom verification algorithm.
4. **MITL Property Verification**: Each component satisfies the MITL properties before system-wide verification.
5. **Overall System Verification**: The minimum step size across components is used to ensure system-wide consistency.
